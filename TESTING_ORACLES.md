# opensteamer Release Oracles

Passing code-path assertions is not release evidence. Each production claim needs an
independent observable outcome from the artifact that actually ran, plus a negative mutation
that demonstrates the oracle fails when that outcome is broken. This document distinguishes
implemented gates from the remaining release boundaries; it is not a feature-completeness claim.

## Critical Guarantees

| Guarantee | Implemented primary oracle | Representative mutation that fails |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Exact product identity | `check-product-identity.sh` parses the Swift package, XcodeGen source, generated project and schemes, iOS/macOS plists, preserved bundle IDs, LaunchAgent paths and logs, npm manifests/lockfiles, and Worker configuration. It resolves PBX target, product-file, build-configuration, and scheme blueprint object IDs instead of trusting display comments. A hosted iOS test also inspects the built app bundle. The public-release gate runs these checks alongside the path-specific former-brand audit. | Change lowercase display casing, rename one project/target, redirect a target or scheme to the wrong PBX object, alter the real product path or configuration name, change a preserved upgrade bundle ID, drift the host/LaunchAgent path, or change one npm/Worker name. Each mutation is exercised independently. |
| Correct Mac host | Freshly build the signed app, verify its actual plist and designated requirements, then require the installed app and live launchd PID to use the same executable and CDHashes. The live process must map the verified installed LiveKitWebRTC framework vnode, and the loaded launchd job must match the checked-in program arguments, environment, `RunAtLoad`, and `KeepAlive` policy. | Run a legacy app, naked SwiftPM binary, wrong Team ID, renamed bundle, symlink, stale installed build or mapped framework, changed launch arguments, or endpoint/auth/DYLD environment override. |
| Durable paired reconnect | The physical driver keeps one non-secret pair fingerprint across three distinct host PIDs and an iPhone cold launch, while requiring a freshly authenticated live media route after every reconnect. | Retain the UI label but delete the Keychain record, reuse a reconnect sequence, or reconnect signaling without advancing inbound/native media. |
| Full-quality audio through the app-observable boundary | The deterministic native loopback evaluates the full aligned 800 ms decoded stereo waveform—including independent 4–15 kHz pilots—for completeness, silence runs, clipping, gain, channel separation, correlation, bandwidth, and both edges. Separate conversion tests exercise source formats. On iPhone, the physical gate drives a coded 500 ms challenge alternating 997/1499 Hz at high level with 8003/11003 Hz at low level. It requires inbound RTP energy plus output-only RemoteIO render-input PCM/callback/frame density, per-channel high/low-band zero-crossing rates, bounded envelope and cumulative per-callback waveform-shape rates, cumulative cross-callback continuity, no near-silence, no recovery rebuild, no callback gap over 25 ms, and the playback/default 48 kHz stereo route. This is pre-system-output evidence, not proof of the later iOS mixer, route processing, DAC, speaker, or acoustic result. | Telephone-band low-pass, first/last or periodic silence, dropped/repeated samples, frozen callbacks, repeated phase-reset 10 ms blocks, rapid 10 ms gain pumping, clipped or flattened/square PCM followed by one healthy callback, mono folding, half-stereo delivery, swapped or impossible band rates, VoiceProcessingIO, callbacks that consume no PCM, recurring 30/40 ms native callback gaps, a late one-shot increment, or counters too sparse for elapsed time. |
| iPhone microphone forwarding into BlackHole | A connection-level unit lease registers the exact default-input listener before writing, saves and freshly resolves the prior UID, requires bounded listener/readback proof, is fenced by the atomic visible-input/hidden-writer pair plus peer/connection generations, and conditionally restores only while it still owns the visible endpoint. Exact default-output/system-output listeners remain installed for the routing session; every delivered selector event synchronously closes a lock-free writer gate, while reopening requires the matching epoch/listener-sequence commit and proven input-lease ownership. Queue startup and the callback's pre-pull/pre-enqueue boundaries consume that gate. The forwarding queue targets only the hidden mirror UID and requires exact current-device readback before and after start; the separate forwarding driver still requires exact track admission, one successful post-start pull, and two advancing progress snapshots. The physical gate records the original input, proves the visible endpoint at the authenticated healthy boundary, requires a current peer/device-generation hidden-writer marker before PCM proof, keeps both BlackHole endpoints off output/system-output defaults, restores the original input after disconnect, opens the visible input by stable UID, and recognizes a known remote challenge. | Conflate the visible and hidden UIDs, omit either queue readback, accept a partial or stale pair, delay selection until track or PCM, omit restoration, restore the wrong UID, treat `noErr` as proof, overwrite a newer external input choice, permit either BlackHole endpoint as output/system output, remove listeners after one poll, reopen from a stale sequence, repair before proving input release, pull/enqueue after gate close, count priming as progress, treat silence or callback count alone as readiness, or replace physical UID-pinned capture with forwarding counters. |
| Active iPhone call isolation | A signed lifecycle suite samples aggregate CallKit state before ordinary activation. Ringing-only startup keeps ordinary best-effort playout while microphone ownership stays closed. Connected-call startup remains globally closed until an exact startup-origin authorization is bound to the first healthy peer, synchronously armed by the quiescent native ADM with zero session side effects, and then proved by fresh inbound/native evidence. A later bare CallKit transition closes only microphone ownership; a genuine interruption replaces any startup authorization with a fresh interruption-origin authorization. Call end revokes hosted ownership and requires a fresh ordinary rebuild plus a newly advancing proof window. | Activate before the startup call sample, open the manual gate before native startup arm, accept an unspecified or wrong origin, bind a startup authorization to a replacement peer, let foreground/route callbacks rebuild after hosted failure, retain startup ownership across a real interruption or call end, accept a suspended pre-call stats read, disconnect the peer, or report Playing before fresh callbacks and frames advance. |
| Background audio | The built-app test inspects `UIBackgroundModes=audio`. The physical gate presses Home for 35 seconds, returns to the app, and requires the original session generation to have accumulated real-time inbound duration/energy and output-only RemoteIO render-input PCM with the coded high/low-band and envelope signatures over the entire interval, without a callback gap, near-silence callback, or audio-unit rebuild. | Remove the capability, stop or mute the track on Home, freeze/replay one callback, suspend RemoteIO, stall for most of the interval, catch counters up only after foregrounding, or reconnect on foreground. |
| Screen Show/Hide | The driver places a nonsecret changing pattern on every Mac display. The physical gate binds an authenticated Show/Active acknowledgement to a stable sequence of at least 12 decoded frames/sec whose independently sampled salted pixel digest changes at least 3 times/sec, then requires a newer authenticated Hide/Inactive acknowledgement and proves audio continues in the same media session. | Acknowledge Show without advancing decoded frames, reuse a stale acknowledgement/renderer, emit one late frame, report 60 fps while pixels change only 1–2 times/sec, advance timestamps over frozen pixels, stop the deterministic visual challenge, or Hide by reconnecting the media session. |

The current Screen gate proves that decoded pixel changes overlap a live deterministic host
challenge at the production renderer boundary, but the decoded pixels do not yet carry a
cryptographic nonce that identifies that exact challenge. It therefore does **not** independently
prove source identity, GPU presentation, or host capture-process quiescence after Hide. The
current remote-input check proves only that a fresh authenticated capability is present;
it does **not** yet drive a disposable Mac target and observe real AX/model mutations. Those claims
remain release-incomplete and must not be inferred from acknowledgements or screenshots.

## Gate Rules

- Prove provenance first: device, app build, code identity, executable path, PID, and fresh
  artifact directory.
- Prefer counters, decoded content, native target state, and exact before/after deltas over labels
  that merely restate internal state.
- Cross-check at least two independent layers for physical media tests, such as host source/RTP
  evidence and iPhone decoded/native-render evidence.
- Require a positive baseline and one-field-at-a-time negative mutants. A test that has never
  been seen rejecting its target defect is not a regression guard yet.
- Never reuse an existing `.xcresult`, log suffix, screenshot, or summary. Bind evidence to the
  current device, PID, build, and run.
- Use bounded ratios for network loss, concealment, and jitter. Reserve exact zero assertions for
  deterministic in-process tests where zero is truly invariant.
- Keep manual sensory checks as exploratory evidence. They do not replace a repeatable waveform,
  pixel/nonce, counter, or target-state oracle.
- RemoteIO callback PCM is before iOS's final system mixer and hardware output. A claim that the
  speaker or headphones sound crisp requires a separate wired or external recording with a
  source-correlated waveform oracle; app-internal counters alone cannot make that claim.
- AudioQueue priming, queue-running state, callback clocks, hidden-writer selection, and forwarding-readiness counters do
  not prove that another Mac application can consume BlackHole input. The physical oracle must
  independently open the visible device by stable UID and recognize a source-correlated remote
  microphone challenge. Hidden-writer selection is nevertheless a required semantic gate: bind
  its pre/post-start UID readback marker to the current host PID, peer generation, and atomic pair
  generation before arming that capture.
- For worldwide-only microphone forwarding, capture the original input plus the
  output and system-output UIDs before connection. Require visible BlackHole as the input at
  the authenticated peer/ICE/control boundary before remote-track or PCM proof,
  exact output and system-output equality throughout, prove the hidden endpoint never becomes
  a default, and require restoration of the
  original input after disconnect. Input notifications caused by the expected
  selection and restoration are allowed and should corroborate ordering; any output
  or system-output notification is a failure.
- Graceful teardown can prove conditional restoration. An in-memory lease cannot
  prove restoration after `SIGKILL`, process crash, kernel failure, or power loss;
  release claims must state that limitation rather than inferring crash recovery.

## Execution and Claim Boundary

- `swift test` covers the deterministic protocol, security, transport waveform, mutation, Mac
  artifact, and validation-driver contracts.
- A **signed** Simulator `xcodebuild test` run covers iOS lifecycle, Keychain, accessibility
  serialization, native PCM publication, and evaluator mutations. An unsigned run is not a
  substitute because it cannot exercise the production Keychain access group.
- A generic-device UI `build-for-testing` proves the physical test source compiles; it does not
  execute a physical oracle.
- Injected CallKit tests prove fail-closed microphone policy, explicit hosted-origin ownership,
  and asynchronous race fencing, not that a real device reports every transition. A signed
  physical-device pass must cold-launch during a real connected iPhone call, prove
  `origin=startup-connected-call`, keep microphone input closed while fresh decoded/native playout
  evidence advances, replace that ownership with `origin=interruption` after a genuine interruption,
  begin that interruption-origin window only after interruption-ended supplies a resume hint, then
  end the final call and require a fresh ordinary audio-policy generation plus new advancing
  render evidence before claiming recovery.
- The production-bundle physical driver binds evidence to a fresh artifact directory, physical
  device identity, installed bundle/build number, signed Mac host, changing host PIDs, session
  identity, and current `.xcresult`. `devicectl` cannot independently prove that the installed
  bytes arrived through TestFlight, so App Store Connect/TestFlight remains the authority for that
  distribution fact.
- The driver binds every retained attachment's name and metadata to its exact XCTActivity. Current
  `xcresulttool` activity JSON does not expose attachment bytes, so attachment contents are
  supplemental audit material; the executing XCTest assertions and pass/fail result—not the
  attachment name—remain the release oracle.
- The waveform gate uses the production Opus/WebRTC path at its 48 kHz stereo target format. It
  does not by itself prove ScreenCaptureKit's source-format conversion; those conversion cases are
  covered separately.
- A newly instrumented physical claim is release-complete only after the matching app build runs
  the non-skipping physical gate and produces a fresh passing result. Build-only evidence, an older
  TestFlight build, a screenshot, or a prior manual pass must not be reported as that result.
